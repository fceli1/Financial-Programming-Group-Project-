Business problem: the bank needs help identifying who is a good client (someone they can offer additional services to at an expected profit) vs a bad client (who to watch carefully in order to minimize bank losses). The bank requires help in order to understand different segments of customers, the common characteristics that define them, and the tailored strategy and services to target them with, in order to maximize profit.
